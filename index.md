Hi, I'm Dane!
-------------
I am a software engineer in Granbury, Texas. I enjoy working hard, learning
new technology, and applying my skills to improve the world around me. I am
passionate about helping people, loving people, and helping people love others.

You can find me organizing bits on [github](https://github.com/dahenson) and occasionally tossing thoughts out on twitter as [@brainofdane](https://twitter.com/brainofdane).
