    <p>It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  Usually, that saying comes riding the tail or a complaint like, "Mommy, he's copying meeee."  It is meant to sooth the person being copied and in some cases deter the copycat by implying some sort of underlying affection.</p>
<p>Recently, a Linux distribution by the name of "Pear Linux" started spreading like wildfire through the elementary community.  Why?  Because "they're copying us!"  It's no secret, either</p>
<p>It's not as smooth or as polished as elementary has come to be, but it is there.  Pear OS clearly uses a form of Gala for window management, wingpanel, and a few other elementary packages.</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have been struggling with whether or not I should share my thoughts on this issue.  I was concerned that the mere mention of Pear Linux would send hordes of elementary users running to their website to download, install, and test their OS.</p>
<p>Of course, the last thing I want to do is give them more credence than they deserve just by attempting to decry their very existence.</p>
<p>Another fear is that we would send elementary zealots at them who would then try to burn their website to the ground with fiery insults and outlandish claims.  Please, forgive me for thinking this of you.  I realize that we are all mature human beings here and I ask that we act civilized to our fellow open source projects.</p>
<h3>Pear is But a Shadow</h3>

<p>It has become clear that the creator of Pear OS is only a one-man team with a relatively small user base.  The elementary team has always been a veritable skeleton crew compared to some of the larger Linux counterparts, but the Pear OS "team" is miniscule in comparison.</p>
<p>With the very talented team of developers and designers at elementary, they are able to put together a much more polished experience and pay great attention to details.  It is more than just a hobby, it is a full-fledged project.  That alone gives elementary a huge leg up on these smaller OS compilations.</p>
<p>What Pear OS is doing is pulling all of the pieces of elementary that have been developed in-house and remixing them in a way that is pleasing to the developer.  He even uses Ubuntu as a base.  Isn't that we want?  Recognition?  Remixing? Repackaging for multiple distributions?</p>
<p>As it turns out, redistributing elementary packages is fine until you start changing names and source code without following GPL licensing.</p>
<h3>Pear is a Non-threat</h3>

<p>The elementary developers themselves have been very clear in stating that they do not feel threatened or upset by the existence of Pear OS.  Their main concern is that the creator is in violation of the GPL, which governs the usage of the individual elementary projects.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the elementary team plans to work with the developer to fix any GPL violations.  As long as he cooperates and operates within the bounds of the Licensing, there won't be any hard feelings.</p>
<p>In the open source spirit, I wish him luck in his endeavor..</p>
