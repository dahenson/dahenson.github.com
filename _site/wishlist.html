<p>This is my wishlist for Birthday/Christmas. This is more for me to keep track
of stuff I want for myself, but it might give other people ideas of what I
like/want.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I usually have an up-to-date list of “want-to-reads” at
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5509110-dane-henson?ref=nav_mybooks&amp;shelf=to-read">goodreads</a>.
I have realized that it feels luxurious to sit down and read a hardback that has
just been published. After years of thrifting for books, it just makes sense to
support authors while treating myself to something nice to hold in my hands.</p>

<h2 id="gadgets">Gadgets</h2>
<p>I like computers and technology.</p>
