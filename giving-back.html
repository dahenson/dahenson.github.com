    <p>I have been a Linux user since 2001.  Back then, I just thought it was a fun toy.  I wanted it to be something I could use daily, but my undeveloped high school brain couldn't find a good use for it.  Honestly, I just like tinkering without bounds.  Twelve years later, I have grown a lot and I find that most of my work can get done faster, easier, and exactly the way I would like if I just do it on a Linux box.</p>
<p>Obvious'd... I know.</p>
<p>These days, my time is very valuable to me.  Therefore, I value the time others put into developing the software I use.  Unfortunately, I don't always have to money to match that value.  For instance, I use inkscape to create images for my own personal use.  Inkscape's proprietary rivals can cost $400 or more for a version that will probably be obsolete by next year.  Though the software may not be worth quite that much, I imagine the people who develop Inkscape would love a slice of that kind of pie.  Developers are not wrong to want compensation for their work.</p>
<p>So, when I have no money to give, I give praise and constructive feedback.  I file bugs and try to help squash them, or at the very least triage.  I really hope that's enough, because though a lot of the work I do is both private and personal, I wouldn't be able to do it without the contributions of these great developers.</p>
