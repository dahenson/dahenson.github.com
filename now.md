This is a ["Now" page](https://sive.rs/nowff). It is a brief overview of what
is happening in my life at the moment.

Living
------
I live in Granbury, TX now.

My wife and I moved our family to a small(er) town in Texas so that we could
feel closer to our roots. We both grew up in small(er) towns--hers was
significantly smaller than mine. There is no idyllic lifestyle to fit every
human, but as soon as we got out of the city we felt at peace. I _would_ wish
that feeling on _anybody_.

I might change my tune in the next 10 years as the DFW urban sprawl overtakes
and consumes Hood County, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

Reading
-------
I am currently reading [The City We Became](http://nkjemisin.com/books/the-city-we-became/)
by N.K. Jemisin.
