Wishlist
========

This is my wishlist for Birthday/Christmas/Whenever. This is more for me to keep track
of stuff I want for myself, but it might give other people ideas of what I
like/want.

Books
-----
I usually have an up-to-date list of "want-to-reads" at
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5509110-dane-henson?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read).

Gadgets

expect most people to understand what these are and why they're here.
