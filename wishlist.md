Wishlist
========
### (Under Construction)

This is my wishlist for Birthday/Christmas. This is more for me to keep track
of stuff I want for myself, but it might give other people ideas of what I
like/want.

Books
-----
I usually have an up-to-date list of "want-to-reads" at
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5509110-dane-henson?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read).
I have realized that it feels luxurious to sit down and read a hardback that has
just been published. After years of thrifting for books, it just makes sense to
support authors while treating myself to something nice to hold in my hands.

Gadgets
-------
I like computers and technology.
